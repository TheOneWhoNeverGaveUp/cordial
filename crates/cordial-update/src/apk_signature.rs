//! Proving Roblox signed the archive, which is what makes an untrusted source
//! acceptable.
//!
//! [ADR-025](../../../docs/adr/ADR-025-fetching-from-a-third-party-mirror.md)
//! permits fetching the build from a distributor that is not Roblox, on one
//! condition: Cordial installs nothing it cannot prove Roblox signed. This is
//! that proof. **The check is the feature and the download is the convenience
//! it buys**, so this module exists before anything that fetches.
//!
//! It is useful without any download at all. Today a user supplies an APK by
//! hand and Cordial trusts it because a person chose it — and the advice
//! circulating in the project's own Discord is to get one from a mirror, next to
//! a warning that anything advertising itself as "modded" is likely malware.
//! Running the same check over a locally-supplied file turns "somebody chose
//! this" into "Roblox signed this".
//!
//! ## Implemented from Google's published specification
//!
//! APK Signature Scheme v2 and v3 are public and documented, so this is written
//! from the specification rather than from any implementation of it. The parts
//! that matter and are easy to get subtly wrong:
//!
//! **The signing block sits between the ZIP entries and the central directory**,
//! and is found by walking back from the End of Central Directory record to the
//! central directory offset, then reading the block's own trailing size and
//! magic. It is not at a fixed place and the EOCD is not at a fixed place
//! either, because either may be followed by a comment.
//!
//! **The digest covers the file in three pieces and one of them is edited.**
//! Everything before the signing block, then the central directory, then the
//! EOCD *with its "offset of central directory" field replaced by the offset of
//! the signing block*. That substitution is the whole reason a signature
//! survives the block being inserted, and forgetting it produces a digest that
//! is wrong for every valid archive — a failure that looks like the archive
//! being bad rather than the verifier being wrong.
//!
//! **Each 1 MiB chunk is digested with a prefix, and so is the concatenation.**
//! `0xa5` for a chunk, `0x5a` for the top level. Without the prefixes a chunk
//! digest and a whole-file digest could collide by construction.
//!
//! ## What this refuses, and why each refusal is not pedantry
//!
//! **A v1-only archive.** v1 signatures cover individual entries rather than the
//! file, so an archive can gain, lose or reorder content and still verify. An
//! archive that offers nothing better is one whose provenance cannot be
//! established this way, and accepting it would make the pin decorative.
//!
//! **A signature that parses but is not checked.** Reading a certificate out of
//! a block proves nothing: whoever supplied the archive supplied the block. The
//! signature over the signed data is verified with the signer's own key, and the
//! content digest is recomputed over the archive and compared. Either step
//! alone is a decoration, and this module would rather not exist than be one.
