//! Keeps the host's OpenXR runtime library loaded once an instance exists.
//!
//! Joining a game after leaving one makes the Quest engine destroy its
//! `XrInstance` and create another (docs/vr/play-button.md). The host loader
//! unloads the runtime library when the last instance goes and loads it again
//! for the next one, at another address, and the engine goes on calling
//! `xrRequestDisplayRefreshRateFB` through the pointer it fetched under the
//! first instance: measured on Monado, the client faulted at the old mapping's
//! base plus `0x3e080`, which is `oxr_xrRequestDisplayRefreshRateFB` in
//! `libopenxr_monado.so`. The specification makes a fetched pointer good for
//! its own instance only, so this is the engine's assumption, not the
//! loader's mistake; that the Quest's runtime survives it, by never being
//! unloaded, is INFERRED.
//!
//! Pinning the library with `RTLD_NODELETE` keeps those addresses mapped and
//! the code at them the runtime's own. That an old instance's pointer then
//! does the right thing for the new one holds for runtimes whose entry points
//! dispatch on the handle passed rather than on the instance they were
//! fetched under, which Monado's do (`oxr_api_*`); for any other runtime it is
//! INFERRED. `CORDIAL_NO_XR_PIN=1` is the control.
