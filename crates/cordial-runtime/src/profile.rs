//! Profiles: which one this instance runs, and where it lives.
//!
//! See [ADR-012](../../../docs/adr/ADR-012-profiles-and-instances.md) for the
//! vocabulary, which matters here. An *instance* is a running Cordial process —
//! a window, which is what Roblox means by the word. A *profile* is the
//! directory this module resolves: one account's Roblox storage, plugin set and
//! flag overrides. An instance runs a profile.
//!
//! **The lock that makes "one instance per profile" true is not here.** It was,
//! in a `Lock`/`acquire` pair that read almost identically to
//! `cordial_shell::profile`'s and that nothing ever called: `cordial-run` used
//! this module for `set_active` and `active` and took no lock at all, so four
//! `--profile CordialTest` engines ran at once on 2026-08-22 and not one was
//! refused. Deleting the copy rather than wiring it up was the fix, because the
//! shell's version already carries the two things the client needs and this one
//! never grew — holder detection for the refusal message, and
//! `Claim::hand_to`'s descriptor inheritance, without which a shell-launched
//! client would be refused its own profile by its own lock. `main` in
//! `bin/load.rs` now calls `cordial_shell::profile::claim_for_instance` before
//! anything touches the directory. This module still decides *which* directory
//! that is.
//!
//! Nothing structurally prevents two Cordial processes opening the same profile.
//! Unlike Fishstrap on Windows there is no singleton mutex to defeat, because
//! each Cordial process is genuinely independent — which is what makes
//! multi-instance nearly free here. That same freedom is the hazard: two
//! instances on one profile are two processes writing one `appData` and one
//! cookie store, and Roblox's storage is not built for it. The failure does not
//! look like "you did something unsupported"; it looks like Cordial corrupting a
//! login.
//!
//! A profile now holds configuration as well as storage — the user's
//! `flags.json`, `plugin-grants.json`, and `plugins/<id>/settings.json` for
//! each plugin that keeps anything. It briefly held the session too, once the
//! engine turned out never to write its cookies anywhere: `cookies` and
//! `identity`, both `0600`. Those moved to the desktop secret service
//! (`secrets.rs`, and ADR-012's second correction) and land here only on a
//! machine that has none. The directory still *keys* them — an item is found by
//! this path — so what a profile is has not changed, only where the bytes are.
//! See
//! [ADR-013](../../../docs/adr/ADR-013-per-profile-configuration.md), which
//! extends ADR-012 and records why grants in particular had to stop being
//! global: a plugin approved in a throwaway profile was silently approved in
//! the profile someone plays on. Only the profile *directory* is decided here;
//! what goes in it is resolved by `flags.rs` and by `cordial_plugins`, both of
//! which take the directory rather than looking it up for themselves.
