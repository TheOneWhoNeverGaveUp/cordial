//! The window's picture while the engine renders to OpenXR: the left eye,
//! copied into the engine's own window swapchain and presented.
//!
//! An XR engine never calls `vkQueuePresentKHR`. The Quest build creates a
//! swapchain on the window surface (1280x721 in every run so far) and then
//! draws only into the runtime's images, so the Wayland subsurface kept
//! whatever it last showed and the window read as frozen. Nothing was wrong
//! with the engine; nobody was presenting.
//!
//! **Where it runs, and why there.** At `xrReleaseSwapchainImage` of the
//! left-eye swapchain, on the thread releasing it, before the call is
//! forwarded -- the same point `cordial_screenshot` reads the eye at
//! (`guest_xr::release`). The image is complete there and still the engine's,
//! in `COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL`. It is also the one moment the session's
//! queue is free to use without a lock: OpenXR makes the *application*
//! externally synchronise that queue across `xrBeginFrame`, `xrEndFrame`,
//! `xrAcquireSwapchainImage` and `xrReleaseSwapchainImage`, because the
//! runtime may submit on it inside them (OpenXR 1.1 §12.25.3). So while this
//! thread is inside the release, no other engine thread may be touching the
//! queue, and a submit here is serialised with the engine's by the engine's own
//! contract. A second thread or a second queue would need a lock the engine
//! does not know to take.
//!
//! **It must never slow the XR loop, so it never waits on the GPU.** The
//! obvious shape -- acquire with a semaphore, submit waiting on it -- would put
//! a wait for the presentation engine *on the XR queue*, ahead of the
//! runtime's own work on it, and a slow compositor would stall the headset.
//! Instead the next window image is acquired one frame ahead with a *fence*,
//! and a frame is mirrored only when that fence has already signalled and the
//! image's previous blit has already completed; otherwise the frame is
//! skipped. The submit waits on nothing. Everything is created once and kept,
//! unlike the capture, because this runs up to once a frame.
//!
//! `CORDIAL_NO_XR_MIRROR=1` turns it off, and with it the two usage bits it
//! adds to the swapchains it reads and writes (`guest_xr` and `vulkan.rs`), so
//! the control is the build without it.
