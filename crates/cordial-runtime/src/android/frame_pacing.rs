//! How evenly the engine is presenting, as opposed to how often.
//!
//! **A frame rate cannot tell you whether something stutters, and this project
//! has the scars to prove it.** AGENTS.md's rule about never quoting present
//! counts as a frame rate is about the same confusion one level down: a count
//! over a window is a mean, and a mean is exactly the statistic that hides
//! judder. A client presenting 120 frames a second in evenly spaced 8.3 ms
//! steps and one presenting 120 frames as sixty pairs 16 ms apart have the same
//! count and look completely different.
//!
//! Reported as "why do I feel like roblox is laggy or stuttering even though
//! its at 120 fps", which is a question the instrumentation could not answer
//! at all -- nothing recorded when a frame went out, only that one did.
//!
//! So this keeps the interval between consecutive presents, and reports the
//! distribution rather than the average. What matters for the feel of it is
//! the tail: p50 is the frame rate everyone quotes, and p99 is the one being
//! complained about.
//!
//! Deliberately cheap, because it runs on the engine's render thread inside
//! `vkQueuePresentKHR` and instrumentation that perturbs the thing it measures
//! is the broken instrument AGENTS.md keeps warning about. One monotonic clock
//! read and two relaxed atomic stores per frame; no allocation, no lock, and
//! nothing that can block the presenting thread.
