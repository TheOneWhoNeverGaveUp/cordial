//! What Cordial does only when the GPU is NVIDIA's, and why each thing is here.
//!
//! **No NVIDIA hardware exists on the development machine.** Two users have
//! since run Cordial on NVIDIA drivers (docs/analysis/nvidia-support.md), but
//! nothing here was checked against those runs beyond what they report. Every behaviour below is one of
//! two kinds and says which. Some are *observations* about the host that are
//! true whatever the hardware is (parsing `/proc/driver/nvidia/version`,
//! comparing a Flatpak extension's name with it). The rest are *reactions to a
//! reported failure*, and are labelled `INFERRED` because what is established
//! is that the failure was reported and what people did about it, never that
//! the reaction fixes it here. `docs/analysis/nvidia-support.md` holds the
//! catalogue with issue numbers; `docs/adr/ADR-046-nvidia-is-gated-on-the-vendor-id.md`
//! holds the rule this file is the implementation of.
//!
//! ## The gate
//!
//! The runtime reads the physical device's `vendorID` out of
//! `vkGetPhysicalDeviceProperties` and everything NVIDIA-shaped keys off that,
//! never off "an NVIDIA kernel module is loaded". A hybrid laptop has the module
//! loaded and renders on the Intel or AMD part half the time; a workaround
//! applied there is a workaround applied to the wrong GPU. The one place this
//! file does look at the kernel module is where the *question* is about the
//! module: whether a Flatpak carries the matching userspace driver.
//!
//! `CORDIAL_FORCE_GPU_VENDOR` exists so the NVIDIA path can be exercised on a
//! machine that has none. It changes what the gate says and nothing the engine
//! sees, in the same sense ADR-042's texture mask is a test-only lever: off by
//! default, named in `--help`, and set by no packaging script.
//!
//! This module is pure on purpose. The three unsafe Vulkan calls that feed it
//! live in `cordial-runtime`, where the rest of that boundary is.
