//! The machine checks live in `cordial_shell::doctor`, because the report
//! screen and this command both show them and the argv path runs before any
//! `GApplication` exists. What is here reads things only this binary holds:
//! where `cordial-run` is, the shell configuration, and which Roblox archive
//! the launcher would use. **It never calls `install::locate`**, which
//! verifies a signature and may extract 116 MB: a report screen that froze for
//! a minute to say whether the engine was present would be worse than the
//! problem it was opened for. It reads the version Cordial recorded, or scans
//! the extracted library, exactly as `diagnostics::roblox` does.
