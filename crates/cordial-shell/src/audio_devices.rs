//! The audio sinks and sources this machine has, for the Audio rows in settings.
//!
//! One question, asked of the same code the client asks: `enumerate_devices()`
//! in `native/pipewire_backend.cpp`, reached through the small C ABI declared
//! at the bottom of `native/pipewire_backend.h`. Nothing here parses
//! `pw-dump`, shells out to `pactl`, or keeps a second idea of what a device
//! is. That matters more than it sounds — the whole point of storing a
//! `node.name` is that the picker and the thing that opens the stream agree
//! about which string identifies a device, and two implementations of "list
//! the sinks" is exactly how they would come to disagree.
//!
//! **The filtering happens on the C side, and one list never carries the
//! other.** The microphone rule at the top of `native/audio_classes.cpp` says
//! listing a microphone is not using one, but it also says nothing on an
//! enumeration path may construct a `CaptureStream`. So `cordial_audio_sinks`
//! drops the sources before allocating, and `cordial_audio_sources` is the one
//! place a microphone list is built: a registry walk and a copy of two strings,
//! with a test below that reads the process's open-capture count before and
//! after and wants zero both times. Sink monitors are not in it, because the
//! registry reports a monitor as a port on its sink and not as a node.
//!
//! **Why the shell links the client's native archive for this.** It is the
//! only reason it does, and it is not free: `cargo build -p cordial-shell`
//! now needs the `third_party/mcpelauncher-linker` submodule and Clang, where
//! before it needed neither. The alternative was a second registry walk
//! compiled only into the launcher, which would have cost nothing at build
//! time and would have been a second answer to the one question this module
//! exists to have exactly one answer to. Only `pipewire_backend.o` is
//! actually extracted from the archive — a static library contributes nothing
//! for symbols nobody references, so the bionic linker and libjnivm are on the
//! link line and not in the binary.

// accidental leftover: deleting this line produces an undefined reference to
// `cordial_audio_sinks` at link time, which is a considerably less obvious
