/// Display refresh sets nothing, which is the engine's own behaviour. A number
/// sets the flag to it, and `cordial_runtime::flag_reapply` puts it back after
/// each of the engine's own settings refreshes, which would otherwise revert it
/// to Roblox's value a couple of minutes in (ADR-051). The row is live: the
/// choice reaches a running client over the settings socket and is applied at
/// once (ADR-044).
///
/// **Separate from `PresentMode`, not a replacement for it.** `fastflags.md`
/// documents these as two levers -- Frame pacing is
/// `VkSwapchainCreateInfoKHR::presentMode`, this is the engine's own
/// scheduler target -- and `PresentMode` is inert in this fork, with the
/// Vulkan backend disconnected. What was missing was a way to raise the
/// *engine's* own cap and have it stay raised.
///
/// **There is no "Unlimited", and nothing above 240.** An earlier draft sent
/// 9999, a number nothing had been measured near. A contributor then tried
/// raising the engine's frame-rate settings to 1000 on a 144 Hz monitor and the
/// frame rate still held at 240, so 240 is where the engine stops (reported in
/// the FPS Flex pull request; not reproduced here, this project has no monitor
/// that fast). A choice above 240 would be a row that does nothing.
