# Flatpak is the primary distribution target (spec §11). Building one on every
# change is worth the minute it costs: it is the only check that the runtime's
# dependencies are actually declared rather than merely present on the machine
# that happens to be building it. A Cordial that runs from `cargo build` but not
# from a Flatpak is a Cordial nobody else can install.
#
# Usage:
#     packaging/build-flatpak.sh [--install]

# commit and skips them out of the `dir` source, so this build clones them at
# those commits and ignores whatever is in the tree. A local edit to either
# submodule will not appear in the Flatpak, which is the point — issue #3 — and
# is worth knowing before spending an afternoon wondering why.
