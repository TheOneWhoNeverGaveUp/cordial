// Roblox's Android audio surface, answered from PipeWire.
//
// This is the Java half of audio. The native half — `libOpenSLES.so`, which
// FMOD uses for game and UI sound — lives in `opensles.cpp` and reaches
// PipeWire through the same backend; nothing here duplicates it. What is here
// are the two things that are *not* OpenSL ES and are easy to assume are:
//
// 1. **Device enumeration is Java.** Roblox asks
//    `AudioManager.getDevices(int)` for an `AudioDeviceInfo[]` and reads seven
//    getters off each element. `SLOutputMixItf::GetDestinationOutputDeviceIDs`
//    exists in `opensles.cpp` and reports zero devices, which is correct — the
//    OpenSL routing surface genuinely is not how Android enumerates audio
//    hardware, and it is not where a device picker gets its list.
//
// 2. **The microphone has two possible doors, and this file is one of them.**
//    This comment used to say the other one did not exist — that Roblox records
//    only through `org.webrtc.voiceengine.WebRtcAudioRecord`, so
//    `SLEngineItf::CreateAudioRecorder` could refuse forever. That was an
//    inference from the dex declaring a WebRTC surface, and
//    `docs/analysis/undefined-symbols.tsv` disagrees: `libroblox.so` links
//    `SL_IID_RECORD`. `opensles.cpp` now implements the OpenSL recorder, with
//    the microphone's lifetime tied to `SLRecordItf`'s record state exactly as
//    the rule below requires. Two doors, then — and both are shut by the same
//    rule rather than one of them being shut by not existing.
//
// Every method below was taken from the shipping dex with `dexproto.py`, not
// from memory of the Android SDK. The seven `AudioDeviceInfo` getters, the
// `getDevices(I)[Landroid/media/AudioDeviceInfo;` shape, the
// `AudioRecord.<init>(IIIII)` argument count and
// `AudioRecord.read(Ljava/nio/ByteBuffer;I)I` rather than the `byte[]`
// overload are all declared surface, and anything not declared there is not
// implemented here.
//
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE MICROPHONE RULE, which the rest of this file is arranged around
// -------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// No PipeWire capture stream may exist while Roblox is not recording.
//
// Not paused, not muted, not connected-but-inactive — absent. A capture stream
// in any of those states still keeps the desktop's microphone indicator lit
// and still shows every other application that Cordial is holding the capture
// device, which is the harm; whether samples are flowing is not the part a
// user can see. `CaptureStream::close()` therefore destroys the `pw_stream`
// rather than deactivating it.
//
// There are exactly four callers of `CaptureStream::open()` in Cordial, three of
// them named here and the AAudio input stream in `aaudio.cpp` the fourth:
// `AudioRecord::startRecording` and `WebRtcAudioRecord::startRecording` below,
// and `AudioRecorderObject::start_capture` in `opensles.cpp`, which runs only
// from `SLRecordItf::SetRecordState(SL_RECORDSTATE_RECORDING)`. All three close
// on stop, on pause (the OpenSL path only — neither `AudioRecord` nor
// `WebRtcAudioRecord` has a pause state to close on) and on destroy. The
// OpenSL half of that was observed against PipeWire's own registry on
// 2026-08-02: no capture node existed while the recorder was merely realized,
// one appeared within half a second of `RECORDING`, and it was gone again on
// `PAUSED`, on `STOPPED` and after `Destroy` — including when the stop came
// from inside the buffer callback. Re-run on 2026-08-28 against this same
// `audio_probe.cpp` OpenSL path — the identical `CaptureStream` primitive
// `WebRtcAudioRecord::startRecording`/`stop` call below, not a second one —
// it held again: a `pw-dump` sampler independently caught the node while
// `SL_RECORDSTATE_RECORDING` and not otherwise, and 590 buffers of real
// samples were read across two record/pause cycles, proving data flowed
// rather than the stream merely existing. A real `cordial-run` session with
// this change built in, 25 s at Roblox's Landing screen with no voice call
// joined, showed zero `cordial-`-named nodes in `pw-dump` throughout. What
// that does not cover — `WebRtcAudioRecord`'s own JNI glue actually being
// driven by the engine end to end — needs a live voice call; see this class's
// own comment and the report accompanying the change that added it.
//
// Two consequences worth stating because they are the kind of thing a later
// change makes by accident:
//
// * **Enumeration must not open anything.** Listing a microphone is not using
//   one. `enumerate_devices()` walks the PipeWire registry and reads
//   properties; it never constructs a `CaptureStream`. If a device picker ever
//   starts lighting the microphone indicator, that invariant is what broke.
//   The Settings microphone picker is that device picker: `cordial_audio_sources`
//   lists, `set_input_device` stores a `node.name` and moves a stream that is
//   already open, and neither creates one. A chosen source is applied only where
//   one of the callers above opens its stream.
//
// * **Failure closes.** Every path below that cannot honour the rule reports
//   failure instead of opening the microphone anyway — including the case
//   where recording starts successfully but the engine's own callback cannot
//   be reached, where the stream is closed again immediately rather than left
//   open delivering samples to nobody. A microphone held open for a recording
//   that is not happening is exactly the state this file exists to prevent.

///
/// Roblox's actual microphone path, and therefore where the rule at the top of
/// this file has to hold in practice rather than in principle: everything
/// below opens `capture` from exactly one place (`startRecording`) and closes
/// it from every path that can end a recording — `stopRecording`,
/// `releaseAudioResources`, and the destructor, for the drop-without-stopping
/// case `WebRtcAudioTrack::stop` and `opensles.cpp`'s `recorder_Destroy` both
/// already guard against.
///
/// **Implemented now.** `initRecording` used to refuse unconditionally because
/// this class had not yet hooked its own `<init>(J)V` and so had no
/// `nativeAudioRecord` handle to hand back through `nativeDataIsRecorded` —
/// the same handle `WebRtcAudioTrack` threads through its own constructor for
/// `nativeGetPlayoutData`. `ctor` below closes that gap the same way.
///
/// **The pull loop is `opensles.cpp`'s `AudioRecorderObject::run_pump`,
/// applied to WebRTC's shape instead of OpenSL's, not a second design.** Both
/// exist for the same underlying fact: `CaptureStream::read` never blocks —
/// its own header says why, and it is the reason `AudioRecord::read` above
/// leaves the polling to whichever Java thread calls it — so whatever drives
/// this class has to supply its own wait. `opensles.cpp` polls at 2 ms because
/// that is a quarter of the shortest buffer either caller uses, WebRTC's own
/// 10 ms frame, and this class is that caller — it uses the same figure
/// rather than picking a second one that could drift out of step with it.
///
/// **What is verified against the shipping dex and what is recalled**, on the
/// same terms `WebRtcAudioTrack`'s own comment below sets out.
/// `initRecording(II)I`, `startRecording()Z`, `stopRecording()Z`,
/// `releaseAudioResources()V`, `nativeCacheDirectBufferAddress
/// (Ljava/nio/ByteBuffer;J)V` and `nativeDataIsRecorded(IJ)V` all came from
/// `tools/dex_method.py` against the shipping dex. That `initRecording`
/// allocates a direct buffer sized to one 10 ms frame and returns its
/// capacity in bytes, and that a dedicated thread stands in for WebRTC's own
/// `AudioRecordThread` reading into that buffer and calling
/// `nativeDataIsRecorded(bytesRead, nativeAudioRecord)` once per full frame,
/// is recalled from WebRTC's long-public `WebRtcAudioRecord.java` and is
/// `INFERRED` rather than read out of Roblox's bytecode body — Roblox's copy
/// of this class is not decompiled anywhere in this tree, only its declared
/// method table is.
///
/// **`setMicrophoneMute` stays exactly as it was: recorded, not acted on.**
/// Real WebRTC zeroes the delivered buffer while muted rather than closing
/// anything — a statement about *content*, which this file has no rule about,
/// not about the *stream*'s existence, which is what the microphone rule
/// above governs — but wiring that in is separate, small work this change
/// does not take on, and the flag was already honestly documented as unused
/// before this change touched anything else in this class.
///
/// **The one-way-door question `WebRtcAudioManager`'s own comment raises is
/// exactly as open as it was**: whether WebRTC's C++ audio device module
/// treats one half failing as fatal to the other has still not been observed

// --------------------------------------- org.webrtc.voiceengine.WebRtcAudioTrack
//
// `org.webrtc.voiceengine.WebRtcAudioTrack`
//
// The voice-chat downlink: playing back what the other side of a call sent.
// Until this class existed, `WebRtcAudioManager::init()` refused specifically
// because this was missing — see that class's own comment — so this is the
// change that lets a signed-in client receive voice audio at all.
//
// **Which of Cordial's three audio paths carries voice chat was established
// by running, not assumed.** A signed-in `cordial-run` reaching Roblox's Home
// screen on 2.736.1408, `--dump-classes` against the real client, shows
// exactly `org/webrtc/voiceengine/{WebRtcAudioManager,WebRtcAudioRecord,
// WebRtcAudioTrack}` under `org/webrtc` — no `org/webrtc/audio/*` (the newer,
// non-deprecated `JavaAudioDeviceModule` some WebRTC builds use instead) and
// nothing under `com/roblox/audio` beyond the existing `AppRtcDeviceWrapper`.
// `docs/analysis/observed-java-surface.md` recorded the same three classes
// from an earlier, Landing-screen-only run, so this is not new information,
// only fresher: the class list has not changed shape across at least one
// build. AAudio's own input path (`native/aaudio.cpp`) and OpenSL ES's
// recorder (`native/opensles.cpp`) are both real, both tested, and both
// unrelated to voice specifically — their own headers say so, and neither
// showed a request from a signed-in session that never touched voice chat.
// **What was not run**: an actual voice call. Reaching one needs GUI
// navigation into a voice-enabled experience, which this change did not have
// a way to drive; see the report accompanying it for exactly what that
// leaves unverified.
//
// **`nativeCacheDirectBufferAddress` and `nativeGetPlayoutData` are native
// methods the *engine* provides, not ones Cordial answers.** Checked against
// `docs/analysis/jni-natives.tsv` — the same exported-symbol table every other
// JNI binding in this tree is checked against — and neither name appears
// there as a `Java_org_webrtc_voiceengine_WebRtcAudioTrack_native...` export.
// WebRTC's own C++ audio glue therefore binds them the way AGDK binds
// `GameActivity`'s lifecycle methods: dynamically, through `RegisterNatives`,
// which is why `find_registered_native` above exists and is used below
// exactly as `cordial_game_activity_start` uses its own copy of the same
// trick in `game_activity.cpp`.
//
// **The pull loop stands in for WebRTC's own `AudioTrackThread`.** Real
// Android has a dedicated Java thread that loops calling
// `nativeGetPlayoutData(sizeInBytes, nativeAudioTrack)` — which fills, in
// place, the direct `ByteBuffer` whose address `initPlayout` cached with
// `nativeCacheDirectBufferAddress` — and then blocks on
// `android.media.AudioTrack.write(..., WRITE_BLOCKING)`. There is no Java
// thread here, so `startPlayout` starts a C++ one that does the same two
// things: pull, then block. The block is `PlaybackStream::enqueue` paced by
// its drain callback, the identical mechanism `AudioDevice::write` above
// already uses and for the identical reason given there — return immediately
// instead and this thread pulls playout data as fast as the CPU allows,
// wildly ahead of anything PipeWire is actually draining, rather than at the
// rate audio is actually leaving the machine.
//
// **What is verified against the shipping dex and what is recalled.** Every
// method name and full descriptor below — `initPlayout(IID)I`,
// `nativeCacheDirectBufferAddress(Ljava/nio/ByteBuffer;J)V`,
// `nativeGetPlayoutData(IJ)V`, and the rest — came from `tools/dex_method.py`
// against the shipping dex, listed in the report accompanying this change.
// That a `WebRtcAudioTrack` object is normally driven by an `AudioTrackThread`
// pulling through a cached direct buffer, and that `initPlayout`'s three
// arguments are sample rate, channel count and a buffer-size multiplier, is
// recalled from WebRTC's own long-public `WebRtcAudioTrack.java` and is
// `INFERRED` rather than read out of Roblox's bytecode body — Roblox's copy
// of this class is not decompiled anywhere in this tree, only its declared
// method table is. The buffer-size arithmetic below is Cordial's own choice
// (WE are standing in for the Java method's entire implementation, so nothing
// downstream depends on reproducing its exact original formula), not a
// transcription of anything Roblox or WebRTC ships.
//
// **The one-way-door question is open, not answered.** `WebRtcAudioRecord`
// above still refuses `initRecording`. Whether the engine's own audio device
// module treats that as fatal to `WebRtcAudioTrack` too — the way a refused
// `AAudioStreamBuilder_openStream` cost FMOD every subsequent audio path, per
// `aaudio.cpp`'s header — has not been observed, because observing it needs a
// live voice call. If a real session shows `startPlayout` never being called
// at all, that is the first thing to check.
